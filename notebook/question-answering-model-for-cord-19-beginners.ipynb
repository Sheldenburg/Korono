    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question-Answering (QA) model\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, a question-answering model is composed of three sources: the `question`, the `context` and the `answer`. The model inputs are the `question` and the `context` and the model output is the `answer`. In most cases, but not all, the `answer` is contained in the `context`. For simplicity, throughout the notebook, we will assume that this is indeed true.\n",
    "\n",
    "It exists many datasets used to train the QA model. One of the most popular is she Stanford Question Answering Dataset, also known as [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/). It contains thousands of tuples of the type (`question`, `context`, `answer`) used to teach the model what does it means to both **find** and **return** a question. During training, the model exploits and learn linguistical properties of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using a search engine to produce the context\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the `context` is quite limited, about one page. In our case, instead, we are dealing with more than 40k papers. **We need therefore to reduce the size of the context**. We do so by selecting all the papers that are most similar to the `answer`. In the code, a very simple algorithm, [Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25), is used. As you will see, even if Okapi BM25 is quite old (from 1980), it does a great job. In future, I plan to compare the Okapi solution against other most recent approaches and solutions such as transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, this is all the code related to the search engine, simple, right? The `search(q)` method returns a data frame containing all papers similar to the query q.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    metadata_df = pd.read_csv()\n",
    "    metadata_df = clean(metadata_df)\n",
    "    cse = CovidSearchEngine(metadata_df) # Covid Search Engine\n",
    "    cse.search(\"what is coronavirus?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From (context, question) to answer with transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most interesting and magic part of all the notebook. Given a question `q` (we use the term query and question interchangeably), the previous section gives us a list of context. Now, for each context and for the same query `q`, we ask to a pre-trained and pretty-powerful transformer model what is the part of the context that **better represent** the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask how in just a few lines of code we can build such a powerful model. The reason why is that we make use of the (great, you need to check it out if you haven't!) [Huggingface transformer library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) that permits us to work with ease with such complex and big neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data obtained now, are dirty and hard to read. That's why for each task and for each question we visualize the context and the highlighted answer in a friendly way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summarization abstract for each question [Coming Soon]\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for the summarization has been written but hasn't been tested and visualized yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Acknowledgement\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been inspired from the great work of:\n",

Pulmonary function testing procedures have been associated with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission among patients/subjects and medical staffs. Effective prevention and control strategies must be compulsorily implemented to prevent nosocomial infection. This recommendation is intended to be followed by healthcare workers (HCWs) of pulmonary function testing laboratory when COVID-19 is in epidemic. Based on the features of pulmonary function testing, precaution principles and strategies are developed in three aspects of management for HCWs, operating procedure, environment and equipment. Indications of pulmonary function testing should be followed strictly. It is strongly recommended to suspend the test for the confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 during the contagious stage, and to postpone the test for other patients if it is not imperative. Medical personnel should mandatorily adhere to the standard stratification of precaution measures. Patients/Subjects should be isolated in a separate area for testing. Disposable in-line filters must be used during pulmonary function testing. Cleaning and disinfection procedures for environment and equipment in pulmonary function testing laboratory should be paid more attention. 新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）主要通过呼吸道飞沫传播及密切接触传播。肺功能检查可增加医务人员和受检者发生COVID-19传播的风险，必须严 格执行有效的预防和控制措施以防止院内感染。为了指导肺功能检查室医务人员做好防控工作，本指引结合肺功能检查的特点，制订了当前疫情下肺功能检查在医务 人员管理、检查流程管理和检查环境物品管理3个方面的要求及注意事项。主要强调在疫情流行期间，必须严格掌握肺功能检查的适应证，强烈建议COVID-1 9确诊病例或疑似病例在传染期内暂缓检查，其他病患如非病情急需也暂缓检查；肺功能室医务人员应严格执行标准分级防护措施；受试者应在单独区域进行隔离检 查；检查时必须使用一次性呼吸过滤器；并重视肺功能检查环境和设备的清洁消毒。.</div>"

Objective This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. Discussion Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory <span class='answer'>droplets</span>. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases. Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine. Conclusion This narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.</div>"

The initial source of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, with pangolins as a potential animal host. Currently the main source of infection is NCP patients, and asymptomatic carriers may also be infectious. <span class='answer'>The virus is believed transmitted mostly via droplets or contact</span>. People are all generally susceptible to the virus. The average incubation period was 5.2 days, and the basic reproductive number R(0) was 2.2 at the onset of the outbreak. Most NCP patients were clinically mild cases. The case fatality rate was 2.38%, and elderly men with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of death. Strategies for prevention and control of NCP include improving epidemic surveillance, quarantining the source of infection, speeding up the diagnosis of suspected cases, optimizing the management of close contacts, tightening prevention and control of cluster outbreaks and hospital infection, preventing possible rebound of the epidemic after people return to work from the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, and strengthening community prevention and control.</div>"

A striking finding was that IFN-α SC could be detected in the fetal liver as early as at <span class='answer'>26 days of gestation</span>, i.e., during the first quarter of gestation, a period at which T-cell markers could not be detected by flow cytometry. In addition, IFN-α SC could be detected in the cord blood, the spleen and the bone marrow of fetuses at later stages of gestation. These data indicate that IFN-α SC appear very early during the ontogeny of the immune system, long before the development of the specific immune system, and may therefore represent an early antiviral defence mechanism. IFN-α SC were found to be associated with hematopoietic organs, which argues for their hematopoietic lineage.</div>"

While several etiological studies have begun to reveal the specific biological features of this virus, the epidemic characteristics need to be elucidated. Notably, a long incubation time was reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to adjustments in screening and control policies. To avoid the risk of virus spread, all potentially exposed subjects are required to be isolated for <span class='answer'>14 days</span>, which is the longest predicted incubation time.

Viral antigen was demonstrated and infectious JHM virus could be recovered from one animal which developed clinical signs at 3 months a.i. In one animal with clinical onset of 8 months a.i., completely remyelinated areas as well as recent demyelinating lesions were observed, suggesting a recurrence of the disease process. Remyelinated areas were also found in 40% of clinically silent animals. The morphology of the late onset of the demyelination was similar to that occurring in SDE. Remyelination consisted of both CNS and PNS-type. This animal model offers the possibility to investigate the virus-host relationship which is responsible for the induction of a demyelinating process after a long incubation period.</div>"

In addition to community onset, nosocomial acquisition and transmission may also occur. Detection of <span class='answer'>asymptomatic</span> shedders (e.g., patients in the incubation period or immunosuppressed long term shedders) facilitates control of nosocomial transmission. Methods: To strengthen the existing infection control concept, a PCR-based screening for RSV and influenza virus was implemented for all patients lacking respiratory symptoms (asymptomatic patients) who were hospitalized on an adult and a pediatric hemato-oncological ward. Laboratory results of this screening were analyzed retrospectively. Results: 665 respiratory specimens were obtained for screening from 251 patients (26% were 18 years and younger) from December 2016 to April 2017. In 23 patients without respiratory symptoms, either influenza virus or RSV infection was found, resulting in a detection rate of about 9%. In 6 patients, the infection was presumably detected during the incubation period, because an increase of viral load was observed in subsequent specimens. Positive screening results facilitated timely implementation of adequate infection control precautions. Nosocomial clusters of RSV or influenza were not detected during the screening period on the two wards. Conclusion: The seasonal screening program expanded our existing infection control concept in terms of patients lacking respiratory symptoms who shed influenza virus or RSV. It enabled us to identify 23 RSV or influenza infections in patients lacking respiratory symptoms in a 4-month period and thus to rapidly take isolation precautions.</div>"

Despite extensive knowledge of AIV in Asian LAMs, little is known about the prevalence South American LAMs. To fill this gap in knowledge, active surveillance was carried out at the major LAM in Medellin, Colombia between February and September 2015. During this period, overall prevalence in the market was 2.67% and a North American origin H11N2 AIV most similar to a virus isolated from Chilean shorebirds <span class='answer'>asymptomatically</span> spread through multiple bird species in the market resulting in 17.0% positivity at peak of infection. Phenotypically, the H11 viruses displayed no known molecular markers associated with increased virulence in birds or mammals, had α2,3-sialic acid binding preference, and caused minimal replication in vitro and little morbidity in vivo. However, the Colombian H11N2 virus replicated and transmitted effectively in chickens explaining the spread throughout the market. Genetic similarity to H11 viruses isolated from North and South American shorebirds suggest that the LAM occurrence may have resulted from a wild bird to domestic poultry spillover event. The ability to spread in domestic poultry as well as potential for human infection by H11 viruses highlight the need for enhanced AIV surveillance in South America in both avian species and humans.</div>"

The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the <span class='answer'>incubation period</span> could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme Ⅱ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network.

To reduce the possibilities of spread, this research creates an infection probability model based on the settling velocity and concentration distribution of infectious droplets. Then, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is employed to track the travel history (time, date and place) of the infected patients. A tree structure algorithm and an infection probability model are applied to trace the transmission routes, discover the correlations between carriers and suspected cases, and finally calculate the infection probability on the basis of time interval. In case of an epidemic outbreak or once an infected case is confirmed, the disease tracking and control system could be initiated by accessing RFID logs to plot the carriers’ time of onset and to trace possible routes of transmission via tree diagrams. The disease tracking and control system developed in this research can assist hospitals in assessing the risk of infection among medical personnel, as well as in prompt implementation of infection prevention and control measures, in order to reduce hospital acquired infections and provide a safe health care setting.</div>"

The initial source of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, with pangolins as a potential animal host. Currently the main source of infection is NCP patients, and <span class='answer'>asymptomatic</span> carriers may also be infectious. The virus is believed transmitted mostly via droplets or contact. People are all generally susceptible to the virus. The average incubation period was 5.2 days, and the basic reproductive number R(0) was 2.2 at the onset of the outbreak. Most NCP patients were clinically mild cases. The case fatality rate was 2.38%, and elderly men with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of death. Strategies for prevention and control of NCP include improving epidemic surveillance, quarantining the source of infection, speeding up the diagnosis of suspected cases, optimizing the management of close contacts, tightening prevention and control of cluster outbreaks and hospital infection, preventing possible rebound of the epidemic after people return to work from the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, and strengthening community prevention and control.</div>"

Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. <span class='answer'>Four different time delays</span> of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2>0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak. This model could provide more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.</div>"

Objectives To investigate the impact of outdoor weather in a temperate climate setting on the seasonal epidemiology of viruses causing respiratory tract infections, particularly influenza A (IFA). Study design In total, 20,062 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples referred for detection of respiratory pathogens using a multiplex PCR panel, between October 2010 and July 2013, were included. Results of PCR detection were compared with local meteorological data for the same period. Results Low temperature and vapor pressure (VP) were associated with weekly incidence of IFA, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus and adenovirus but <span class='answer'>no association with relative humidity was found</span>. The incidence of human rhinovirus and enterovirus was independent of temperature. During seasonal IFA outbreaks, the weekly drop of average temperature (compared with the week before) was strongly associated with the IFA incidence recorded the following week. Conclusion A sudden drop in outdoor temperature might activate the annual influenza epidemic in a temperate climate by facilitating aerosol spread in dry air. These conditions also seem to affect the incidence of other respiratory pathogens but not human rhino- or enterovirus, suggesting that routes of infection other than aerosol may be relevant for these agents.</div>"

This study aims to explore the association between coronavirus disease (COVID-19) death and weather parameters. Methods In this study, we collected the daily death number of COVID-19, meteorological and air pollutant data from 20 January, 2020 to 29 February, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Then, the generalized additive model was applied to explore the impact of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on <span class='answer'>daily mortality</span> of COVID-19. Results There were in total 2299 COVID-19 mortality counts in Wuhan. A positive association with COVID-19 mortality was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = −0.32). In addition, each 1 unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 mortality at lag 3. However, both per 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 mortality at lag 3 and lag 5, respectively. Conclusion In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality.</div>"

The present study reanalyzed 7 historical datasets which recorded monthly cases or deaths. In addition to time series analyses of reported data, an estimation and spectral analysis of the effective reproduction number at calendar time t, R(t), were made. Meteorological variables were extracted from a report in India from 1890–1921 and compared with smallpox mortality as well as R(t). Annual cycles of smallpox transmission were clearly shown not only in monthly reports but also in the estimates of R(t). Even short-term epidemic data clearly exhibited an annual peak every January. Both mortality and R(t) revealed significant negative association (P < .01) and correlation (P < .01), respectively, with humidity. These findings suggest that smallpox transmission <span class='answer'>greatly varies with season</span> and is most likely enhanced by dry weather.</div>"

However the importance of transmission via fomites is unclear since few data exist on the survival of virus on commonly touched surfaces. We therefore measured the viability over time of two H1N1 influenza strains applied to a variety of materials commonly found in households and workplaces. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 (PR8) or A/Cambridge/AHO4/2009 (pandemic H1N1) viruses were inoculated onto a wide range of surfaces used in home and work environments, then sampled at set times following incubation at stabilised temperature and humidity. Virus genome was measured by RT-PCR; plaque assay (for PR8) or fluorescent focus formation (for pandemic H1N1) was used to assess the survival of viable virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genome of either virus could be detected on most surfaces <span class='answer'>24 h</span> after application with relatively little drop in copy number, with the exception of unsealed wood surfaces. In contrast, virus viability dropped much more rapidly. Live virus was recovered from most surfaces tested four hours after application and from some non-porous materials after nine hours, but had fallen below the level of detection from all surfaces at 24 h. We conclude that influenza A transmission via fomites is possible but unlikely to occur for long periods after surface contamination (unless re-inoculation occurs). In situations involving a high probability of influenza transmission, our data suggest a hierarchy of priorities for surface decontamination in the multi-surface environments of home and hospitals.</div>"

Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease <span class='answer'>interventions and intensity</span>. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.</div>"

Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naive population. As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively. The latest estimates of the cCFR were 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.6) for scenario 1 and 7.7% (95% CI: 4.9-11.3%) for scenario 2, respectively. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.3) and 3.7 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.3) for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on the results, we note that current 2019-nCoV epidemic has a substation potential to cause a pandemic.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed on 150 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in the fever clinic of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January to February in 2020, including 126 mild cases and 24 cases in critical care. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the correlation of past medical history including hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) , as well as the levels of serum NT-proBNP and cTnI to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. Results: Age, hypersensitive C-reactive protein(hs-CRP) and serum creatinine levels of the patients were <span class='answer'>higher in critical care cases than in mild cases</span>(all P<0.05). Prevalence of male, elevated NT-proBNP and cTnI, hypertension and coronary heart disease were significantly higher in critical cases care patients than in the mild cases(all P<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, male, elevated NT-proBNP, elevated cTnI, elevated hs-CRP, elevated serum creatinine, hypertension, and CHD were significantly correlated with critical disease status(all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that elevated cTnI(OR=26.909, 95%CI 4.086-177.226, P=0.001) and CHD (OR=16.609, 95%CI 2.288-120.577, P=0.005) were the independent risk factors of critical disease status. Conclusions: COVID-19 can significantly affect the heart function and lead to myocardial injury. The past medical history of CHD and increased level of cTnI are two independent determinants of clinical disease status in patients with COVID-19.</div>"

This meta-analysis is to analyze the correlation between hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: Available data from PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, WanFang Database and VIP Database, were analyzed using a fixed effects model meta-analysis to derive overall odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Funnel plots and Begg's were used to assess publication bias. Findings: Of 182 articles found following our initial search, we assessed 34 full-text articles, of which 9 articles with 1936 COVID-19 patients met all selection criteria for our meta-analysis. No significant heterogeneity between studies. There were significant correlations between COVID-19 severity and hypertension [OR=2.3 [95% CI (1.76, 3.00), P<0.01], diabetes [OR=2.67, 95% CI (1.91, 3.74), P<0.01], coronary heart disease [OR=2.85 [95% CI (1.68, 4.84), P<0.01]. Most of the studies in the funnel plot are on the upper part and few on the base part, and are roughly symmetrical left and right. Begg's test: hypertension (Z=-0.1, P=1.0), diabetes (Z=0.73, P=0.466), coronary heart disease (Z=0.38, P=0.707), all found no publication bias. Interpretation: Hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease can affect the severity of COVID-19. It may be related to the imbalance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the cytokine storm induced by Glucolipid metabolic disorders (GLMD).</div>"

The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. METHODS: A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID-19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. RESULTS: A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart.</div>"

This meta-analysis is to analyze the correlation between hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: Available data from PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, WanFang Database and VIP Database, were analyzed using a fixed effects model meta-analysis to derive overall odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Funnel plots and Begg's were used to assess publication bias. Findings: Of 182 articles found following our initial search, we assessed 34 full-text articles, of which 9 articles with 1936 COVID-19 patients met all selection criteria for our meta-analysis. No significant heterogeneity between studies. There were significant correlations between COVID-19 severity and hypertension [OR=2.3 [95% CI (1.76, 3.00), P<0.01], diabetes [OR=2.67, 95% CI (1.91, 3.74), P<0.01], coronary heart disease [OR=2.85 [95% CI (1.68, 4.84), P<0.01]. Most of the studies in the funnel plot are on the upper part and few on the base part, and are roughly symmetrical left and right. Begg's test: hypertension (Z=-0.1, P=1.0), diabetes (Z=0.73, P=0.466), coronary heart disease (Z=0.38, P=0.707), all found no publication bias. Interpretation: Hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease can affect the severity of COVID-19. It may be related to the imbalance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the cytokine storm induced by Glucolipid metabolic disorders (GLMD).</div>"

Here, using quantitative phosphoproteomics, we reveal the unique phosphoproteome dynamics that occur in the host cell within minutes of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We uncover cellular kinases required for the observed signaling pattern and find that inhibition of selected candidates, such as the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), leads to decreased IAV replication. As <span class='answer'>GRK2 has emerged as drug target</span> in heart disease, we focus on its role in IAV infection and show that it is required for viral uncoating. Replication of seasonal and pandemic IAVs is severely decreased by specific GRK2 inhibitors in primary human airway cultures and in mice. Our study reveals the IAV-induced changes to the cellular phosphoproteome and identifies GRK2 as crucial node of the kinase network that enables IAV replication.</div>"

These are essential for maintenance of protein balance of the cell; once this balance gets disturbed, it may lead to cell death. Thus, cystatins cannot be merely regarded as TPI’s as these have been found to play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies have reported the variation in cystatin level in incidences of different types of cancer; highlighting an important role played by these inhibitors in cancer development and progression. Cystatin C is increasingly replacing creatinine as a biomarker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) thereby highlighting the importance of this important inhibitor. Some recent studies have also reported the interaction pattern of various anti-cancer drugs with cystatins in a bid to find how these drugs affect this important inhibitors and whether these drugs have any side effect on cystatins. Thus, in this growing disease era it can be said that cystatins are no more just inhibitors blocking the activity of thiol proteases rather they play a pivotal role in variety of pathological conditions.</div>"

However, in animal models, especially cats (a common model of spinal cord injury and associated bladder pathology), anesthesia is often required for these procedures and can be a research confounder. This study compared the effects of select agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone, propofol, isoflurane, and α-chloralose) on urodynamic (Δpressure, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (<span class='answer'>change in heart rate</span> [ΔHR], average heart rate [HR], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated cystometrograms across five adult male cats. Δpressure was greatest with propofol, bladder capacity was highest with α-chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with α-chloralose. Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. Cats progressed to a deeper plane of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller ΔHR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol and alfaxalone. Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery was shortest with dexmedetomidine. These agent-specific differences in urodynamic and anesthetic parameters in cats will facilitate appropriate study-specific anesthetic choices.</div>"

       "    </style><div class=\"single_answer\">Our understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis and consequences of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has increased substantially in the last decade. Several new lines of evidence demonstrate that bacterial isolation from sputum during acute exacerbation in many instances reflects a cause-effect relationship. Placebo-controlled antibiotic trials in exacerbations of COPD demonstrate significant clinical benefits of antibiotic treatment in moderate and severe episodes. However, in the multitude of antibiotic comparison trials, the choice of antibiotics does not appear to affect the clinical outcome, which can be explained by several methodological limitations of these trials. Recently, comparison trials with nontraditional end-points have shown differences among antibiotics in the treatment of exacerbations of COPD. Observational studies that have examined clinical outcome of exacerbations have repeatedly demonstrated certain clinical characteristics to be associated with treatment failure or early relapse. Optimal antibiotic selection for exacerbations has therefore incorporated quantifying the risk for a poor outcome of the exacerbation and choosing antibiotics differently for low risk and high risk patients, reserving the broader spectrum drugs for the high risk patients. Though <span class='answer'>improved outcomes</span> in exacerbations with antibiotic choice based on such risk stratification has not yet been demonstrated in prospective controlled trials, this approach takes into account concerns of disease heterogeneity, antibiotic resistance and judicious antibiotic use in exacerbations.</div>"

This study assessed the infective viral etiologies by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations. In addition, infective etiologies were assessed for association with the clinical outcome of the patients. METHODS: Adults admitted with AECOPD and asthma exacerbations between August 2016 and July 2017 were recruited. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were obtained from the patients within 1–2 days of admission and subjected to pathogen detection and human rhinovirus (HRV) typing. RESULTS: Altogether 402 patients with AECOPD, <span class='answer'>80 stable</span> COPD, 100 asthma exacerbation and 21 stable asthma subjects were recruited. Among those admitted for AECOPD and asthma exacerbations, 141(35.1%) and 45(45.0%) respectively had pathogens identified in the NPA specimens. The commonest virus identified was influenza A followed by HRV. HRV typing identified HRV-A and HRV-C as the more common HRV with a wide variety of genotypes. Identification of pathogens in NPA or HRV typing otherwise did not affect clinical outcomes including the hospital length of stay, readmission rates and mortality except that identification of pathogens in asthma exacerbation was associated with a lower rate of readmissions at 30 and 60 days. CONCLUSIONS: Many respiratory viruses were associated with AECOPD and asthma exacerbation. HRV-A and HRV-C were the more common HRV associated with exacerbations. Identification of pathogens in NPA was associated with less readmissions for asthma patients at 30 and 60 days. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02866357.

The effects of short-term high-dose steroid treatment on viral load and adaptive immunity to RSV have not been examined in adults. Objectives The objectives of this study were to measure peak viral load and duration of viral shedding, serum and nasal cytokines, RSV-specific antibody response, and lymphocyte subsets in patients admitted to the hospital with RSV infection and to compare patients treated with steroids to patients untreated with steroids. Methods Hospitalized adults who tested positive for RSV by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on admission had respiratory samples collected for quantitative RT-PCR and cytokine analysis. Serum and nasal secretions were tested for RSV antibody and lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry at 2 days, 2 weeks, and 1 month. Main Results Thirty-three of 50 (66%) patients hospitalized with RSV received systemic steroids for a mean duration of 11 days. Those who received steroids more frequently wheezed and were less often febrile. There were no serious adverse events related to steroids and no significant differences in peak viral load, duration of RSV shedding, nasal cytokines, or lymphocyte subsets in patients treated with steroids and patients untreated with steroids. Antibody responses to RSV were slightly blunted in the steroid-treated group. Conclusions Short courses of systemic steroids in patients hospitalized with RSV infection did not affect viral load or shedding. Humoral immunity may be mildly diminished, and thus potential benefits of systemic steroids must be balanced against potential risks.</div>"

It is important to know the microorganisms that commonly cause exacerbations in the patient groups classified according to clinical and functional characteristics for fast and accurate treatment of acute exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: The last Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) publication recommended a new staging system containing obstruction degree, frequency of exacerbations, and quality of life questionnaires. This study is designed to analyze the relationship between the bacteria isolated in acute exacerbations and new GOLD stages. METHODS: Potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPB) isolation with culture and polymerase chain reaction methods were obtained from 114 acute exacerbation COPD patients, classified into A, B, C, and D groups by analyzing the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) value, COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, and exacerbation frequency according to the new GOLD staging system. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between exacerbation frequency and PPB isolation (P=0.002). There was no relationship between GOLD stage, FEV(1), and CAT score with PPB isolation. The isolated bacteria diversity and mixed infection frequency were higher in the GOLD stage D group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated only from D group patients. CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection may cause an acute exacerbation equally in each stage for COPD. The difference in bacterial etiology is more related to exacerbation frequency than FEV(1) and CAT scores for an acute exacerbation. Determining exacerbation frequency is significant for treatment success in empirical antibiotic selection.</div>"

We examined the hypothesis that bacteria and viruses may modulate this heterogeneity and that interactions between bacterial and viral infection may affect <span class='answer'>changes in airway bacterial load and the clinical features and inflammatory responses of exacerbations</span> in patients with COPD. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Outpatient Department, London Chest Hospital, London, UK. Patients Thirty-nine patients with COPD. Measurements We prospectively studied 56 COPD exacerbations, obtaining clinical data and paired sputum and serum samples at baseline and exacerbation. Qualitative and quantitative microbiology, polymerase chain reaction detection for rhinovirus, and estimation of cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed. Results A total of 69.6% of exacerbations were associated with a bacterial pathogen, most commonly Haemophilus influenzae. Rhinovirus was identified in 19.6% of exacerbations. The rise in bacterial load at exacerbation correlated with the rise in sputum interleukin (IL)-8 (r = 0.37, p = 0.022) and fall in FEV1 (r = 0.35, p = 0.048). Exacerbations with both rhinovirus and H influenzae had higher bacterial loads (108.56 cfu/mL vs 108.05cfu/mL, p = 0.018) and serum IL-6 (13.75 pg/mL vs 6.29 pg/mL, p = 0.028) than exacerbations without both pathogens. In exacerbations with both cold symptoms (a marker of putative viral infection) and a bacterial pathogen, the FEV1 fall was greater (20.3% vs 3.6%, p = 0.026) and symptom count was higher (p = 0.019) than those with a bacterial pathogen alone. Conclusions The clinical severity and inflammatory responses in COPD exacerbations are modulated by the nature of the infecting organism: bacterial and viral pathogens interact to cause additional rises in inflammatory markers and greater exacerbation severity.</div>"

Objective We assessed the prevalence of C. pneumoniae infections in adult patients with acute exacerbations of asthma. Methods One hundred sixty-eight adult patients with acute exacerbations of asthma and 108 control subjects matched for age, sex, and <span class='answer'>smoking status</span> were studied. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from all subjects and analyzed by isolation in cell culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for C. pneumoniae. Serum samples were also obtained and tested for C. pneumoniae-specific antibodies by the microimmunofluorescence test. Results C. pneumoniae was isolated from two (1.2%) asthma patients and none from controls and detected by PCR from nine (5.4%) cases and one (0.9%) control. Both culture positive specimens were also positive in PCR. Further, serologic evidence of acute C. pneumoniae infection was present in 15 (8.9%) of asthma patients and in three (2.8%) of controls (P = .048). The prevalence of C. pneumoniae-specific IgG and IgA was significantly higher in asthma cases than in controls (IgG >/= 1:16; 85.1% versus 67.6%, P = .001; IgA ≥ 1:16: 47.6% versus 16.7%, P < .001). Mean titer of IgG and IgA was also significantly greater in asthma cases than in controls (IgG: 38.8 versus 18.1, P = .0001; IgA: 17.2 versus 6.1, P = .0001). Conclusion Our data suggest that C. pneumoniae infection may trigger acute exacerbations of adult asthma.</div>"

Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating <span class='answer'>current screening and containment strategies</span>, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4—3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.</div>"

By January 2020, the potential risks imposed by 2019-nCoV in human health and economical activity were promptly highlighted. Considerable efforts have been devoted for understanding the transmission mechanisms aimed to pursue public policies oriented to <span class='answer'>mitigate the number of infected and deaths</span>. An important question requiring some attention is the role of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature and humidity) in the 2019-nCoV transmission. Correlations between meteorological temperature and relative humidity with the number of daily confirmed cases were explored in this work for the epicenter city of Wuhan, China for the period from 29 January to March 6, 2020. Long-term trend of temperature and relative humidity was obtained with a 14-days adjacent-averaging filter, and lagged correlations of the number of daily confirmed cases were explored. The analysis showed negative correlations between temperatures with the number of daily confirmed cases. Maximum correlations were found for 6-day lagged temperatures, which is likely reflecting the incubation period of the virus. It was postulated that the indoor crowding effect is responsible of the high incidence of 2019-nCoV cases, where low absolute humidity and close human contact facilitate the transport of aerosol droplets.</div>"

According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme Ⅱ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.</div>"

Fox circovirus is highly similar to dog circoviruses identified in diseased dogs in USA and Italy, and to a recently discovered circovirus of foxes with neurologic disease from the United Kingdom.

Virus has been isolated from dromedary camels in endemic areas, and many camels also have neutralizing antibodies against the virus, suggesting that they are likely a reservoir host. In order to better understand the role of camels in virus transmission we experimentally infected 3 adult, male dromedary camels with a human isolate of MERS CoV. All animals developed a transient, upper respiratory tract infection associated with very minor clinical disease. Large quantities of infectious virus were isolated from nasal secretions from each animal through 7 days post-inoculation, and viral RNA was detected much longer. Although our study design was limited to 3 animals, these data indicate that MERS CoV readily infects camels, which shed large amounts of virus and <span class='answer'>likely can efficiently transmit virus to other camels and humans</span>.</div>"

Animals vaccinated twice intramuscularly or intramammarily with live attenuated TGE virus developed high levels of antibodies in serum and colostrum, but the levels in milk declined markedly within a few days post-farrowing. In contrast, animals naturally or experimentally infected with virulent virus generally developed lower levels of antibodies in serum and colostrum but maintained higher levels in milk, as compared to the vaccinated animals. Gel filtration studies indicated that antibodies in milk from vaccinated animals were primarily of the IgG class, whereas those from the naturally or experimentally infected animals were primarily of the IgA class. <span class='answer'>The ability of sows to transmit a high degree of passive immunity to their suckling progeny</span> was more closely associated with TGE antibodies of the IgA than the IgG class. Present evidence suggests that high levels of TGE antibodies of the IgA class occur in milk as a result of an infection of the intestinal tract. Probable reasons for this are discussed.</div>"

The multi-host ecology of zoonoses leads to complex dynamics, and analytical tools such as mathematical modeling are vital to the development of effective control policies and research agendas. Much attention has focused on modeling pathogens with simpler life cycles and immediate global urgency, such as influenza and SARS, but vector-transmitted, chronic, and protozoan infections have been neglected, as have crucial processes such as cross-species transmission.

The epidemic outbreak cased by <span class='answer'>coronavirus</span> 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented. Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time. Methods. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989. Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted. Conclusions. Simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV in mainland China. The further research should focus on updating the predictions with the use of fresh data and using more complicated mathematical models.</div>"

This phenomenon, known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease, is a factor in numerous human and veterinary diseases. It is thought to result from innate cellular responses to Fcγ receptor-facilitated entry of infectious microbial immune complexes, and paradoxically results in increased production of pathogenic organisms. ADE has been described in vitro in numerous settings, but the strongest data regarding the in vivo impact of this mechanism on human disease come from human disease and animal models of <span class='answer'>dengue and leishmanial infections</span>.

In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamic of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus 2 closely related <span class='answer'>bat</span> strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GeneBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on the 25th November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19th January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</div>"

It has high accuracy, sensitivity and wide dynamic range in addition to medium- to high-throughput capabilities. These features make MS a superior platform for analysis of various biomolecules including proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Until recently, MS was applied for protein detection and characterization. During the last decade, however, MS has successfully been used for molecular diagnostics of microbial and viral infections with the most notable applications being identification of pathogens, genomic sequencing, mutation detection, DNA methylation analysis, tracking of transmissions, and characterization of genetic heterogeneity. These new developments vastly expand the MS application from experimental research to public health and clinical fields. Matching of molecular techniques with specific requirements of the major MS platforms has produced powerful technologies for molecular diagnostics, which will further benefit from coupling with <span class='answer'>computational tools</span> for extracting clinical information from MS-derived data.</div>"

Also, plant pathogen genomes are starting to be used to investigate plant disease epidemics such as the wheat blast outbreak in Bangladesh. While these genome-based approaches provide never-seen advantages over all previous approaches with regard to public health and biosecurity, they also come with new vulnerabilities and risks with regard to cybersecurity. The more we rely on genome databases, the more likely these databases will become targets for cyber-attacks to interfere with public health and biosecurity systems by compromising their integrity, taking them hostage, or manipulating the data they contain. Also, while there is the potential to collect pathogen genomic data from infected individuals or agricultural and food products during disease outbreaks to improve disease modeling and forecast, how to protect the privacy of individuals, growers, and retailers is another major cyberbiosecurity challenge. As data become linkable to other data sources, individuals and groups become identifiable and potential malicious activities targeting those identified become feasible. Here, we define a number of potential cybersecurity weaknesses in today's pathogen genome databases to raise awareness, and we provide potential solutions to strengthen cyberbiosecurity during the development of the next generation of pathogen genome databases.</div>"

Specimen from a SARS patient was inoculated into cell culture. The presence of SARS-CoV was determined by RT-PCR and confirmed by electron microscopy. Virus was isolated followed by the determination of its genome sequences, which were then analyzed by comparing with other 46 SARS-CoV genomes. Genetic mutations with potential implications to pathogenesis and the epidemic were characterized.

In this Communication, we first analyzed two recent studies that concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions share a unique similarity to HIV-1. However, the reimplementation of the analyses, built on larger scale data sets using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, presents clear evidence that rebuts these conclusions. Next, using metagenomic samples from Manis javanica, we assembled a draft genome of the 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus, which shows 73% coverage and 91% sequence identity to the 2019-nCoV genome. In particular, the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed <span class='answer'>four times more variations</span> in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 than in the Manis coronavirus compared with 2019-nCoV, suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of 2019-nCoV from bats to human.</div>"

As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and <span class='answer'>11 countries or regions</span> were affected.MethodsWe downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.ResultsAn isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1·05 × 10−2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 × 10−4 to 2.72 × 10−2) for N, 5.34 × 10−3 (5.10 × 10−4, 1.28 × 10−2) for S, 1.69 × 10−3 (3.94 × 10−4, 3.60 × 10−3) for P, 1.65 × 10−3 (4.47 × 10−4, 3.24 × 10−3) for the whole genome, respectively. At this nucleotide substitution rate, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs appeared about 0.253-0.594 year before the epidemic.ConclusionOur analysis suggests that at least two different viral strains of 2019-nCoV are involved in this outbreak that might occur a few months earlier before it was officially reported.</div>"

Examination of these studies showed they lacked validity due to a low sensitivity to detect HAO, and because they pre-date both advanced healthcare systems and the emergence of recent nosocomial pathogen challenges. The accepted inference: that as there are so few HAOs the focus of surveillance programmes should be on endemic and not epidemic infections (outbreaks), is therefore called into question. Current estimates of HAI burden are derived from Point Prevalence Surveys (PPS) which are neither designed to nor are capable of detecting HAOs. We considered the extensive <span class='answer'>Infection Prevention and Control Team</span> (IPCT) work to prevent and prepare for perennial and novel HAOs and suggest that at present this endeavour is largely unseen, underestimated and undervalued. Any HAI burden estimate needs to comprise a more complete HAI summary than PPS data. This can only be done with a more inclusive surveillance system that has a wider focus than just prevalent infections. There is a real risk of redirection of the IPCT resource from outbreak prevention and preparedness work towards HAI that are counted: such a change could only further increase HAO risks.</div>"

Here, we characterized how strategy and technology could be mobilized to improve the effectiveness of infection prevention and control in hospitals during the outbreaks of Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Asia and West Africa. Published literature on the hospital-borne outbreaks of SARS, Ebola, and MERS in Asia and West Africa was comprehensively reviewed. The results showed that healthcare systems and hospital management in affected healthcare facilities had poor strategies and inadequate technologies and human resources for the prevention and control of HAIs, which led to increased morbidity, mortality, and unnecessary costs. We recommend that governments worldwide <span class='answer'>enforce disaster risk management</span>, even when no outbreaks are imminent. Quarantine and ventilation functions should be taken into consideration in architectural design of hospitals and healthcare facilities. We also recommend that health authorities invest in training healthcare workers for disease outbreak response, as their preparedness is essential to reducing disaster risk.</div>"

An average of 18.6 Gb (14.8 to 25.7 Gb) of raw Illumina paired end sequence data was generated, cleaned, trimmed and mapped against reference sequence databases for bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes. An average of 106,839 (0.06%) reads were assigned to resistance genes with genes encoding resistance to tetracycline, macrolide and beta-lactam resistance genes as the most abundant in all samples. We found significantly higher abundance and diversity of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance, including critical important resistance (e.g. bla(CTX-M)) carried on airplanes from South Asia compared to North America. Presence of Salmonella enterica and norovirus were also detected in higher amounts from South Asia, whereas Clostridium difficile was most abundant in samples from North America.

Among the therapeutic options available, long-acting corticosteroids are frequently used due to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Although they may improve the clinical symptoms, they can lead to a progressive form of the disease that becomes refractory to treatment. Furthermore, their direct relationship with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) is well known. Consequently, these drugs are controversial and <span class='answer'>not recommended</span> for routine management of FCGS. Recombinant feline interferon-omega (rFeIFN-ω) is an immunomodulatory compound. Recently, its daily oral administration has been shown to be successful in treating refractory cases of FCGS. This case study describes two clinical cases of type II DM complicated by FCGS. Both animals were calicivirus positive and they had been previously treated with long-acting corticosteroids, which may have been the major cause of DM. The two cats were treated with glargine insulin (Lantus, starting dose 1 IU/cat twice daily (BID)), achieving remission 10 and 18 weeks later respectively. Considering the difficulty with control of FCGS in these animals, an oral daily dose of rFeIFN-ω was started as an alternative to long-acting corticosteroids. In both cats oral clinical signs gradually improved and 60 days after the start of therapy the owners reported a significant relief of pain during mastication. According to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first case report that describes the successful use of rFeIFN-ω in the management of FCGS in type II diabetic cats, in which long-acting corticosteroids are contraindicated.</div>"

Here, we discuss the various mechanisms of SARS-CoV-mediated inflammation. We also assume that SARS-CoV-2 likely shares similar inflammatory responses. Potential therapeutic tools to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block FcR activation. In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury. Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. However, these strategies, as proposed here, <span class='answer'>remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness</span>.</div>"

First, pregnant women are at increased risk for influenza-associated illness and death. The effects on the fetus of maternal influenza infection, associated fever, and agents used for prophylaxis and treatment should be taken into account. Pregnant women might be reluctant to comply with public health recommendations during a pandemic because of concerns regarding effects of vaccines or medications on the fetus. Guidelines regarding nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., <span class='answer'>voluntary quarantine</span>) also might present special challenges because of conflicting recommendations about routine prenatal care and delivery.

Using qualitative interview data, perspectives from both health administrators and service providers working at all levels of China’s health care system were examined. Service providers admitted selective adherence and non-adherence to universal precautions in their daily medical practice, and gave their explanations for such behaviors. Lack of time to put on protective gear, gear’s interference with medical procedures, lack of administrative support, heavy workload in hospitals, inaccurate risk assessment, and beliefs that compliance with universal precautions is unnecessary, time consuming and costly were mentioned as reasons behind noncompliance.

Methods A cross-sectional survey study guided by the health belief model was conducted in 2009. The study questionnaire is valid (content validity index, 0.81) and reliable (Cronbach α range, 0.65-0.94). Results There were 678 questionnaires analyzed, with a response rate of 68.9%. The mean frequency score of SPs compliance was 4.38 ± 0.40 out of 5. Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test indicated that year 2 and year 4 students had better SPs compliance than year 3 students. Further analysis using a univariate general linear model identified an interaction effect of perceived influence of nursing staff and year of study (F1,593 = 3.72; P < .05). The 5 following predictors for SPs compliance were identified: knowledge of SPs, <span class='answer'>perceived barriers</span>, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff. Conclusion Although the SPs compliance among NSs was high, the compliance varied by year of study and was affected by the nursing staff. Furthermore, SPs compliance among NSs can be enhanced by increasing SPs knowledge, providing more SPs training, promoting management support, reducing identified SPs barriers, and improving nursing staff compliance to SPs.</div>"

The aim of this study was to identify the preventive advice and interventions received by Australian pilgrims before Hajj, and the barriers to and <span class='answer'>facilitators</span> of their use during Hajj. Methods Two cross-sectional surveys of Australians pilgrims aged ≥18 years were undertaken, one before and one after the Hajj 2014. Results Of 356 pilgrims who completed the survey (response rate 94%), 80% had the influenza vaccine, 30% the pneumococcal vaccine, and 30% the pertussis vaccine. Concern about contracting disease at Hajj was the most cited reason for vaccination (73.4%), and not being aware of vaccine availability was the main reason for non-receipt (56%). Those who obtained pre-travel advice were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who did not seek advice. Of 150 pilgrims surveyed upon return, 94% reported practicing hand hygiene during Hajj, citing ease of use (67%) and belief in its effectiveness (62.4%) as the main reasons for compliance; university education was a significant predictor of hand hygiene adherence. Fifty-three percent used facemasks, with breathing discomfort (76%) and a feeling of suffocation (40%) being the main obstacles to compliance. Conclusion This study indicates that there are significant opportunities to improve awareness among Australian Hajj pilgrims about the importance of using preventive health measures.</div>"

Study objectives were to explore the vaccination status and determinants in T2DM patients in southwestern Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study on a representative sample of T2DM patients in Abha city, southwestern Saudi Arabia, was conducted. Data for sociodemographic characteristics, clinical criteria, vaccination status, vaccination motivators and barriers and seasonal influenza knowledge were collected. Out of 353 T2DM patients included in the study, seasonal influenza vaccination coverage was 61% in year 2017. A significant factors associated with non-vaccination were; <span class='answer'>poor influenza and its vaccine knowledge</span> (OR = 4.31, 95% CI: 2.73–6.80), illiteracy (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.11–3.37), and more than 10 years disease duration (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.11–3.87). Presence of family history of DM and ischemic heart comorbidity minimized the possibility of non-vaccination (OR = 0.54 and 0.28 respectively). Healthcare givers’ advice was the most reported vaccination motivator (84.7%) while; fear of vaccine side effects was the most stated barrier (73%). In conclusion, influenza vaccination rate among T2DM in the present study is less than the recommended level. Continuous primary health care center-based educational programs should be implemented to aware and encourage influenza vaccination among T2DM patients.</div>"

Although handwashing is a proven infection control measure, barriers exist in the <span class='answer'>school environment</span>, which hinder compliance to this routine. Currently, alternative hand hygiene techniques are being considered, and one such technique is the use of antimicrobial rinse-free hand sanitizers. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to examine the effectiveness of antimicrobial rinse-free hand sanitizer interventions in the elementary school setting. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological , CINAHL, HealthSTAR and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched for both randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. Absenteeism due to communicable illness was the primary outcome variable. RESULTS: Six eligible studies, two of which were randomized, were identified (5 published studies, 1 published abstract). The quality of reporting was low. Due to a large amount of heterogeneity and low quality of reporting, no pooled estimates were calculated. There was a significant difference reported in favor of the intervention in all 5 published studies. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence for the effectiveness of antimicrobial rinse-free hand sanitizer in the school environment is of low quality. The results suggest that the strength of the benefit should be interpreted with caution. Given the potential to reduce student absenteeism, teacher absenteeism, school operating costs, healthcare costs and parental absenteeism, a well-designed and analyzed trial is needed to optimize this hand hygiene technique.</div>"

Emergency department (ED) clinicians are at high risk of exposure to both these and common communicable diseases. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended to protect clinicians from acquiring, or becoming vectors of, infection, yet compliance is typically sub-optimal. Little is known about factors that influence use of PPE—specifically <span class='answer'>gloves and masks</span>—during routine care in the ED. Methods This was an ethnographic study, incorporating documentation review, field observations and interviews. The theoretical domains framework (TDF) was used to aid thematic analysis and identify relevant enablers of and barriers to optimal PPE use. Results Thirty-one behavioural themes were identified that influenced participants’ use of masks and gloves. There were significant differences, namely: more reported enablers of glove use vs more barriers to mask use. Reasons included more positive unit culture towards glove use, and lower perception of risk via facial contamination. Conclusion Emerging infectious diseases, spread (among other routes) by respiratory droplets, have caused global outbreaks. Emergency clinicians should ensure that, as with gloves, the use of masks is incorporated into routine cares where appropriate. Further research which examines items of PPE independently is warranted.</div>"

But lung-protective ventilation with adjusted positive end-expiratory pressure remains the most effective therapeutic tool despite advances in prone positioning, inhalation of nitric oxide and the use of steroids.

The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics and outcomes of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza and other respiratory viruses. METHODS: Clinical data of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with respiratory viruses January 2014–June 2018 were reviewed. Respiratory viral infection was identified by multiplex reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Among 126 patients who underwent multiplex RT-PCR, respiratory viral infection was identified in 46% (58/126): 28 patients with influenza and 30 patients with other respiratory viruses. There was no significant difference in baseline and clinical characteristics between patients with influenza and those with other respiratory viruses. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was <span class='answer'>more frequent in patients with influenza than in those with other respiratory viruses</span> (32.1% vs 3.3%, p=0.006). Co-bacterial pathogens were more frequently isolated from respiratory samples of patients with pulmonary ARDS infected with influenza virus than those with other respiratory viruses. (53.6% vs 26.7%, p=0.036). There were no significant differences regarding clinical outcomes. In multivariate analysis, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II was associated with 30-mortality (odds ratio, 1.158; 95% confidence interval, 1.022–1.312; p=0.022). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral infection was not uncommon in patients with pulmonary ARDS. Influenza virus was most commonly identified and was associated with more co-bacterial infection and ECMO therapy.</div>"

Cybercare means “health care in cyberspace” — for example, doctors consulting with patients via videoconferencing across a distributed network; or patients receiving care locally — in neighborhoods, “minute clinics,” and homes — using information technologies such as telemedicine, smartphones, and wearable sensors to link to tertiary medical specialists. This model contrasts with traditional health care, in which patients travel (often a great distance) to receive care from providers in a central hospital. The Cybercare model shifts health care provision from hospital to home; from specialist to generalist; and from treatment to prevention. Cybercare employs advanced technology to deliver services efficiently across the distributed network — for example, using telemedicine, wearable sensors and cell phones to <span class='answer'>link patients to specialists</span> and upload their medical data in near-real time; using information technology (IT) to rapidly detect, track, and contain the spread of a global pandemic; or using cell phones to manage medical care in a disaster situation. Cybercare uses seven “pillars” of technology to provide medical care: genomics; telemedicine; robotics; simulation, including virtual and augmented reality; artificial intelligence (AI), including intelligent agents; the electronic medical record (EMR); and smartphones. All these technologies are evolving and blending. The technologies are integrated functionally because they underlie the Cybercare network, and/or form part of the care for patients using that distributed network. Moving health care provision to a networked, distributed model will save money, improve outcomes, facilitate access, improve security, increase patient and provider satisfaction, and may mitigate the international global burden of disease. In this paper we discuss how Cybercare is being implemented now, and envision its growth by 2030.</div>"

As a result, geriatric service has evolved to encompass primary care, to include outreach geriatrics and psychogeriatric support to long-term residential care homes as well as frail elderly people living at home. There is room for innovation in the provision of community care, led by geriatricians, especially in management of chronic disease, incorporating the components of <span class='answer'>self management</span> and use of telemedicine.

However, human-based interpretation of CT imaging is time consuming. More than that, substantial inter-observer-variation cannot be ignored. We aim at developing a diagnostic tool for artificial intelligence (AI)-<span class='answer'>based classification of CT images</span> for recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung. Experimental Design: In this study, images were retrospectively collected and prospectively analyzed using machine learning. CT scan images of the lung that show or do not show COVID-19 were used to train and validate a classification framework based on convolutional neural network. Five conditions including COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and normal lung were evaluated. Training and validation set of images were collected from Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan Hospital whereas test set of images were collected from Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University and the fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Results: Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the AI framework were reported. For test dataset, accuracies for recognizing normal lung, COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis were 99.4%, 98.8%, 98.5%, 98.3%, and 98.6%, respectively. For the test dataset, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of recognizing COVID-19 were 98.8%, 98.2%, 98.9%, 94.5%, and 99.7%, respectively. Conclusions: The performance of the proposed AI framework has excellent performance of recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung, which also has balanced sensitivity and specificity.</div>"

For this purpose, we have been constructing a knowledge base by organizing various experimental and computational observations as a collection of if—then rules. Here we report an expert system, which utilizes this knowledge base, for predicting localization sites of proteins only from the information on the amino acid sequence and the source origin. We collected data for 401 eukaryotic proteins with known localization sites (subcellular and extracellular) and divided them into training data and testing data. Fourteen localization sites were distinguished for animal cells and 17 for plant cells. When sorting signals were not well characterized experimentally, various sequence features were computationally derived from the training data. It was found that 66% of the training data and 59% of the testing data were correctly predicted by our expert system.

In the time of an epidemic crisis, we hoped artificial intelligence (AI) to help reduce physician workload in regions with the outbreak, and improve the diagnosis accuracy for physicians before they could acquire enough experience with the new disease. Here, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images to detect COVID-19 pneumonia features. Different from conventional medical AI, we were dealing with an epidemic crisis. Working in an interdisciplinary team of over 30 people with medical and / or AI background, geographically distributed in Beijing and Wuhan, we were able to overcome a series of challenges in this particular situation and deploy the system in four weeks. Using 1,136 training cases (723 positives for COVID-19) from five hospitals, we were able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.974 and specificity of 0.922 on the test dataset, which included a variety of pulmonary diseases. Besides, the system <span class='answer'>automatically highlighted all lesion regions for faster examination</span>.

Currently, there is no specific therapy or vaccine with proven effectiveness for MERS-CoV infections. Methods A combination of ribavirin and interferon therapy was used for the treatment of five MERS-CoV-positive patients. We reviewed the therapeutic schedule and the outcome of these patients. Results All patients were critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with <span class='answer'>adjunctive corticosteroids</span> and were on mechanical ventilation at the time of initiation of therapy. The median time from admission to therapy with ribavirin and interferon was 19 (range 10–22) days. None of the patients responded to the supportive or therapeutic interventions and all died of their illness. Conclusions While ribavirin and interferon may be effective in some patients, our practical experience suggests that critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities who are diagnosed late in the course of their illness may not benefit from combination antiviral therapy as preclinical data suggest. There is clearly an urgent need for a novel effective antiviral therapy for this emerging global threat.</div>"

In this contribution we discuss infections by influenza A (H5N1), SARS and Hanta virus. The H5N1 subtype of avian influenza (bird flu) has crossed the species barrier and causes severe illness in humans. So far, 328 humans in twelve countries have contracted the disease and 200 have died. The young are particularly affected. Oseltamivir is the antiviral drug of choice and should be given as early as possible. Patients require supportive care, often including <span class='answer'>invasive ventilation</span>. If H5N1 develops the ability to transmit efficiently between humans, an influenza pandemic is likely. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first seen in China in 2002. The outbreak was finally contained in 2003, by which time 8098 probable SARS cases had been identified with at least 774 deaths. The virus was identified in 2003 as belonging to the coronaviridae family. SARS is transmitted between humans and clusters have been seen. The mainstay of treatment is supportive. Various antiviral agents and adjunctive therapies were tried but none were conclusively effective. Hanta virus is an emerging cause of viral lung disease. In 1993, a new species of Hanta virus was recognized, after an outbreak of a new rapidly progressive pulmonary syndrome in the US, 465 cases of ‘Sin Nombre’ virus have now been seen in the US with a mortality rate of 35%. Many of the confirmed cases had contact with rodents (the major host of hanta viruses). Treatment is supportive, as there is no specific therapy.</div>"

Chronic periodontitis patients were classified based on their compliance level, and factors affecting PC-SPT and the prognosis of PC-SPT were investigated. METHODS: This study selected 206 patients who started SPT after receiving periodontal treatment between 2010 and 2012. Patients who continued SPT through February 2016 were included. The patients were classified according to whether they exhibited complete compliance (100% of visits), excellent compliance (≥70% of visits), incomplete compliance (<70% of visits), or non-compliance (only 2 visits). Patient characteristics that could affect PC-SPT, such as age, sex, distance of the clinic from their residence, implantation, and periodontal treatment, were investigated. The number of newly decayed and extracted teeth, alveolar bone level changes around the teeth and implants, and implant removal were examined to evaluate the prognosis of PC-SPT. RESULTS: Sex and the presence of an implant significantly affected PC-SPT.

Likewise, confirmatory studies of sirolimus without concomitant corticosteroid therapy should be explored as a research priority. Other agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including non-immune intravenous immunoglobulin, N-acetylcysteine, acute use of statins, macrolides, pamidronate, nitazoxanide, chloroquine, antiC5a antibody, interferons, human mesenchymal stromal cells, mycophenolic acid, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors agonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, mesalazine, herbal medicine, and the role of plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion as rescue therapy have supportive preclinical or observational clinical data, and deserve more investigation preferably by RCTs.

Common presentations of confirmed cases include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum production, shortness of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The reported severe/critical case ratio is approximately 7-10% and median time to intensive care admission is 9.5-10.5 days with mortality of around 1-2% varied geographically.

In China, Chinese medicine is proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial guidelines with substantial utilization. We reviewed the latest national and provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine. We have also reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1 management with hypothesized mechanisms and latest in silico findings to identify candidate Chinese medicines for the consideration of possible trials and management. Given the paucity of strongly evidence-based regimens, the available data suggest that Chinese medicine could be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic option in the management of COVID-19.</div>"

In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several <span class='answer'>adjunctive pharmacologic interventions</span> have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different therapeutics both individually and in combination.

Currently, diagnosis relies on nonspecific physiological criteria and culture-based pathogen detection. This results in diagnostic uncertainty, therapeutic delays, the mis- and overuse of antibiotics, and the failure to identify patients who might benefit from <span class='answer'>immunomodulatory therapies</span>. There is a need for new sepsis biomarkers that can aid in therapeutic decision making and add information about screening, diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring of the response to therapy. The host response involves hundreds of mediators and single molecules, many of which have been proposed as biomarkers. It is, however, unlikely that one single biomarker is able to satisfy all the needs and expectations for sepsis research and management. Among biomarkers that are measurable by assays approved for clinical use, procalcitonin (PCT) has shown some usefulness as an infection marker and for antibiotic stewardship. Other possible new approaches consist of molecular strategies to improve pathogen detection and molecular diagnostics and prognostics based on transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolic profiling. Novel approaches to sepsis promise to transform sepsis from a physiologic syndrome into a group of distinct biochemical disorders and help in the development of better diagnostic tools and effective adjunctive sepsis therapies.</div>"

Direct diagnostic methods assay for the presence of the virus, while indirect methods test for effects of the virus. Cell culture is the process of growing cells or tissues in the laboratory. Cell lines can be infected with patient samples to allow viral replication within the cells; observable cytopathic effects can help to identify the identity of the virus. Infected cells can also be used for immunofluorescence assays, which use fluorescently labeled virus-specific antibodies to identify viruses in fixed cells or tissues. <span class='answer'>A variety of diagnostic immunoassays</span> exist, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays/enzyme immunoassays, western blots, lateral flow immunoassays, and agglutination reactions.

It causes respiratory infection with signs and symptoms of common infectious agents. Thus, clinicians sometimes may miss the H1N1 patient. Clinical laboratory tests are important for the diagnosis of the H1N1 infection. There are <span class='answer'>several tests available</span>, however, the rapid test and direct fluorescence antigen test are unable to rule out the influenza virus infection and viral culture test is time consuming. Therefore, nucleic acid amplification techniques based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays are regarded as a specific diagnosis to confirm the influenza virus infection. Although the nucleic acid-based techniques are highly sensitive and specific, the high mutation rate of the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase could limit the utility of the techniques. In addition, their use depends on the availability, cost and throughput of the diagnostic techniques. To overcome these drawbacks, evaluation and development of the techniques should be continued. This review provides an overview of various techniques for specific diagnosis of influenza infection.</div>"

Notably, the development of replicating-competent reporter-expressing viruses (RCREVs) has provided an excellent option to detect directly viral replication without the use of secondary labeling, which represents a significant advance in virology. This article reviews the applications of RCREVs in diagnostic and molecular virology, including <span class='answer'>rapid neutralization tests</span>, high-throughput screening systems, identification of viral receptors and virus-host interactions, dynamics of viral infections in vitro and in vivo, vaccination approaches and others. However, there remain various challenges associated with RCREVs, including pathogenicity alterations due to the insertion of a reporter gene, instability or loss of the reporter gene expression, or attenuation of reporter signals in vivo. Despite all these limitations, RCREVs have become powerful tools for both basic and applied virology with the development of new technologies for generating RCREVs, the inventions of novel reporters and the better understanding of regulation of viral replication.</div>"

To assess the distribution of AvRVs in chickens and turkeys, we have developed <span class='answer'>specific PCR protocols</span>. These protocols were applied in two field studies investigating faecal samples or intestinal contents of diseased birds derived from several European countries and Bangladesh. In the first study, samples of 166 chickens and 33 turkeys collected between 2005 and 2008 were tested by PAGE and conventional RT-PCR and AvRVs were detected in 46.2%. In detail, 16.1% and 39.2% were positive for AvRVs of groups A or D, respectively. 11.1% of the samples contained both of them and only four samples (2.0%) contained rotaviruses showing a PAGE pattern typical for groups F and G. In the second study, samples from 375 chickens and 18 turkeys collected between 2009 and 2010 were analyzed using a more sensitive group A-specific and a new group D-specific real-time RT-PCR. In this survey, 85.0% were AvRV-positive, 58.8% for group A AvRVs, 65.9% for group D AvRVs and 38.9% for both of them. Although geographical differences exist, the results generally indicate a very high prevalence of group A and D rotaviruses in chicken and turkey flocks with cases of diarrhoea, growth retardation or RSS. The newly developed diagnostic tools will help to investigate the epidemiology and clinical significance of AvRV infections in poultry.</div>"

Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, environmental controls, <span class='answer'>personal protective equipment</span>, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.</div>"

These viruses transmit primarily through droplets and other bodily secretions. In the ophthalmology practice, healthcare workers may be particularly susceptible to these infections. Firstly, ophthalmologists are extremely reliant on physical examination during patient consultation. Of particular concern is the proximity between the patient and ophthalmologist during the slit lamp microscope examination. It has been shown that droplets from a cough or sneeze can be propelled for up to 6?m [8], a range that definitely encompasses the distance between the patient and ophthalmologist. Secondly, during the SARS-CoV epidemic, clinical reports have suggested tears as a medium of infection. In a case series by Loon et al., it was shown that viral RNA of the SARS-CoV can be detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the tears of infected individuals [9]. While anecdotal in nature, such accounts highlight the possible infectivity of tears, a fluid which ophthalmologists and instruments come in contact on a daily basis. If true, this represents a crucial need for further development of disinfection and personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols for the ophthalmology clinic.SN - 1476-5454</div>"

Despite the sharp rise in the incidence of COVID-19, authoritative recommendations to limit the spread of SARS-CoV2 within gastrointestinal endoscopy units are lacking. Therefore, with the primary aim of identifying best practice and scrutinizing its supporting evidence, we conducted a systematic review of literature for articles published between 1 January 2002 and 15 March 2020 in five databases relating to both the current SARS-CoV2 and the previous SARS-CoV outbreaks. Official websites for gastroenterology and endoscopy societies in the 15 most affected countries were also searched. Unfortunately, a paucity of high quality data and heterogeneity of recommendations between countries was observed. Interestingly, not all countries advocated the postponement of non-urgent or elective procedures. Recommendations for patient screening and <span class='answer'>personal protective equipment were commonly featured in all recommendations but specifics varied</span>. Only 32% (9/28) of all gastroenterology and endoscopy societies issued guidance on endoscopy in the COVID-19 pandemic.
